      <p>Chapter Co-President (Regenesis UTM: August 2024 - Present)
	  </p>
	  <p>- I manage operations for an environmental and sustainability organization. I am also involved in implementing initiatives that drive ecological awareness and community involvement. Every Thursday, I help coordinate our weekly Farmers Market, which connects the community with local produce and environmentally friendly products. This position has developed my organizational and leadership abilities, especially in creating engaging and impactful events.

	  <p>Active Member (Alpha Gamma Delta: August 2024 - Present)
	  </p>
	  <p>- I am currently volunteering at The Friday Food Ministry, a program at St. Thomas Church supporting Toronto’s unhoused and under-housed population through meal service. I am also involved in other sorority initiatives such as fundraising and property caretaking.  
	  <p>Technologist (Scholastica Literature Club: April 2022 - May 2023)
	  </p>
	  <p>-  I was responsible for analyzing and resolving technical issues to support club activities. I have also designed flyers and social media content to promote events, increasing engagement and attendance. Notably, I helped organize a bake sale fundraiser to raise funds for an International Mother Language Day event for my school. This experience sharpened my event planning skills and underscored the importance of cultural awareness and community engagement.
	  </p>
	  <p>Strategist (Scholastica Literature Club: April 2020 - June 2021)
